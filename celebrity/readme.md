## Celebrity

This is my first project using node. It is still very much a work in progress. 

It's supposed to be a webapp version of [Celebrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_(game)), a game like charades. It will allow players to join a dynamically created "room", input their name, the words that they'd like to submit to pool, and then organize the gameplay.

This also allowed me to learn how to use sockets for instant updates from player to player.

It doesn't work yet (the sockets do though!).
