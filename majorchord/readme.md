## Chord Diagram of Major to Career

This is project that I created at Middlebury as part of an independent study. It uses a chord layout to visualize the path from major to career area. Unfortunately, the data are fake (randomly generated). The highlighted areas on the left of the page are clickable; using them, you can dial into the different majors.

It was written using d3 in JavaScript.
